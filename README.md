# Kingslayer
A mod for classic kag2d. Written in C++ and uses telnet to communicate with remote server.
I am no longer working on this, so therefore I have decided to open source it.

## Technical Details
- The program was built around 2012 in VSExpress 2008 edition.
- It uses the boost library for the telnet client, threading, lexical casting and more.
- To connect the program correctly you will need a running server in kag2d and your config.ini set to match the server credentials.
