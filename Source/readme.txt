*** To-Do: ***
King cannot be reelected without a delay
People can change their vote nominations instead of being able to vote for more than 1 person
Make /duel command?
Remove votes with player leaving

*** Changes? ***
Check out making custom class for seclev for kings?
Bigger map (New maps: Underground maps, cliff/sky maps, add custom caves on bottom of map)
Wage war against people WITHOUT a king? Maybe kill X number of people to end the war?
Anti-Grief ignores small collapses, freezes -> kicks -> ban on bigger collapses
Anti-RK freezes, then kicks, then bans
Add in a delay for changing king
Add in a delay for waging wars
Add in a delay for signing treaty
Need command to end war
Fill the chat with information when a war is waged or ended so everyone notices.
Auto team balance? And adapts to player count so people can only join exotic teams once the player count goes up.
Make teamswitch delay to around 5 seconds to prevent people from spamming teamswitch and switching right after griefing?
Set builder damage down and build speed up?
Automatically print out wars/kings
Fewer votes need to become king as people are clearly absolutely retarded.

*** Bugfixes: ***
Check king/votes when people changes teams to prevent bugs
